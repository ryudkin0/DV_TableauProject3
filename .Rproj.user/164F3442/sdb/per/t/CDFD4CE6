The MBS data sets are the underlying records of the mortgages that comprise the security. Each one has the fields: \n-ID (#)\n-Occupancy (Owner Occupied, Second Home, Investor Owned)\n-State\n-Type (Fixed, Varaible)\n-LTV (Loan-To-Value ratio of loan / home price)\n-CLTV (Combined-Loan-To-Value ratio of all loans / home price)\n-Orig Rate (Interest Rate)\n-Orig Term (Length of mortgage in months)\n\nThe Unemployment data set has the following fields:\n-State\n-Unemployment Rate\n\nWe used the following info to connec to the database:\nServer: 129.152.144.84\nService: ORCL.usuniversi01134.oraclecloud.internal\nPort: 1521\nUsername: C##cs329e_ry2634\nPassword: orcl_ry2634\n\"\n\n```\n\n##** Visualization # 1:**\n\n### Vis 1 - AVG FICO by State for both MBS #1 and MBS #2\n![](./Final_Vis1.png)\n\n### Vis 1 - Steps to reproduce\n```{r}\n\"\nPut State in columns\nPut MBS #1 FICO in rows\n\"\n```\n![](./Vis1_SS1.png)\n```{r}\n\"\nSet the data relationship to be by state\nChange meausre values to be averages\n\"\n```\n![](./Vis1_SS2.png)\n```{r}\n\"\nAdd MBS #2 to the Y axis\nAdd color by measure name\nFilter by state\n\"\n```\n![](./Vis1_SS3.png)\n\n##** Visualization # 2:**\n\n### Vis 2 - Interest Rate V. Unemployment Rate by State\n![](./Final_Vis2.png)\n\n### Vis 2 - Steps to reproduce\n```{r}\n\"\nPut Occupancy in columns\nPut Interest Rate in rows\nSet the data relationship to be by state\n\"\n```\n![](./Vis2_SS1.png)\n```{r}\n\"\nAdded unemployment rate to the y axis\nConverted measure values to be averages\n\"\n\n```\n![](./Vis2_SS2.png)\n```{r}\n\"Converted graph to scatterplot\"\n```\n![](./Vis2_SS3.png)\n```{r}\n\"\nChanged shape to filled in circles\nAdded color by state\nAdded state labels\nChanged the axis range\n\"\n```\n![](./Vis2_SS4.png)\n\n### Vis 3 - AVG CLTV by State for both MBS #1 and MBS #2\n![](./Final_Vis3.png)\n\n### Vis 3 - Steps to reproduce\n```{r}\n\"\nPut State in columns\nPut MBS #1 CLTV in rows\nPut MBS #2 CLTV in rows\nSet the data relationship by state\n\"\n```\n![](./Vis3_SS1.png)\n```{r}\n\"\nColored by measure names\nChange measure values to be by avg\nFiltered by State\nAdjusted Y Axis\n\"\n```\n![](./Vis3_SS2.png)\n\n##** Visualization # 4:**\n\n### Vis 4 - FICO V. Unemployment Rate by State\n![](./Final_Vis4.png)\n\n### Vis 4 - Steps to reproduce\n```{r}\n\"\nPut State in rows\nPut Unemployment Rate in columns\nSet the data relationship to be by state\nAdd FICO to y axis\n\"\n```\n![](./Vis4_SS1.png)\n```{r}\n\"\nConvert to scatterplot\nChange Axis\nFill shapes\nColor by state\nAdd label by state\n\"\n\n```\n![](./Vis4_SS2.png)\n\n\n###Have a great day Mr. Li and Dr. Cannata!!!##\n\n\n\n",
