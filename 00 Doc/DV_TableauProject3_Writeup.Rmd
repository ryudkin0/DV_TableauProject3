##** Connect to Data Sources **

```{r}
"
The first step is to connect to the data
We had 3 different data sources:
1) MBS #1
2) MBS #2
3) Unemployment Rates

MBS stands for Mortgage backed security. The MBS data sets are the underlying records of the mortgages that comprise the security. Each one has the fields: 
-ID (#)
-Occupancy (Owner Occupied, Second Home, Investor Owned)
-State
-Type (Fixed, Varaible)
-LTV (Loan-To-Value ratio of loan / home price)
-CLTV (Combined-Loan-To-Value ratio of all loans / home price)
-Orig Rate (Interest Rate)
-Orig Term (Length of mortgage in months)

The Unemployment data set has the following fields:
-State
-Unemployment Rate

We used the following info to connec to the database:
Server: 129.152.144.84
Service: ORCL.usuniversi01134.oraclecloud.internal
Port: 1521
Username: C##cs329e_ry2634

### Vis 1 - Steps to reproduce
```{r}
"
Put State in columns
Put MBS #1 FICO in rows
"
```
![](./Vis1_SS1.png)
```{r}
"
Set the data relationship to be by state
Change meausre values to be averages
"
```

```{r}
"
Add MBS #2 to the Y axis
Add color by measure name
Filter by state
"
```

### Vis 2 - Steps to reproduce
```{r}
"
Put Occupancy in columns
Put Interest Rate in rows
Set the data relationship to be by state
"
```
![](./Vis2_SS1.png)
```{r}
